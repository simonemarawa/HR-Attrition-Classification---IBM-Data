# HR-Attrition-Classification---IBM-Data
This note book focuses on analysis on why people are leaving an organisation. It uses the IBM HR data available from Kaggle.

This project consists of three objectives:

1. Perform exploratory analysis to extract meaningful insight from the data.
2. Identify the best features to be used for modeling.
3. Train, test, and refine various classification models to best predict which employees attrited. The predictive models to be trained are:
      - Logistic Regression
      - Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
      - Kernel Support Vector Classifier (Kernel SVC)
      - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
      - Decision Tree
      - Random Forest

4. Apply the best performing model to the test set
